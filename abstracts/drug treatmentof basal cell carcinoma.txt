Introduction: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent skin malignancy, 
with incidence increasing worldwide. Most BCC can be cured with local treatments 
(surgery or topical therapies), but advanced or recurrent forms require specific 
therapies. Significant developments targeting the sonic hedgehog signalization 
pathway have been made in the past years, paving the way for new therapies.Areas 
covered: This review details emerging drugs for BCC treatment, focusing on 
topical, intra-tumoral, and systemic therapies, such as new targeted therapies 
and immune checkpoint inhibitors. A literature search was conducted to identify 
ongoing studies using PudMed database and clinicaltrials.gov website.Expert 
opinion: Although surgery is and will probably remain the gold-standard therapy 
for BCC, treatment of recurrent, advanced, and metastatic tumors is evolving. 
Emergence of tumors resistant to targeted therapies lead the way to new 
approaches. Topical and intra-tumoral treatments represent alternatives to 
surgical morbidity, and many studies are ongoing. The first results of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors are encouraging in advanced and metastatic forms of the 
disease. New targeted therapies are needed to overcome or prevent the resistance 
to standard hedgehog pathway inhibitors.
