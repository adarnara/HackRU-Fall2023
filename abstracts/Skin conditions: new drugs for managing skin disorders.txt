New drugs are available for managing several common skin disorders. For 
psoriasis, topical corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy, but topical 
vitamin D3 analogs, such as calcipotriene, now have a role. They are as 
effective as medium-potency topical steroids but without steroid side effects, 
though they can induce hypercalcemia if the dose exceeds 100 g/week. For more 
severe cases, methotrexate has been widely used, but other drugs now also are 
prescribed. They include calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, and more 
recently, biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. For 
children and pregnant women, in whom the previously discussed drugs are not 
appropriate, narrowband UV-B light often is the first-line treatment. For 
eczema, patients requiring steroid-sparing topical drugs can be treated with 
calcineurin inhibitors (ie, pimecrolimus or tacrolimus); between the 2, 
tacrolimus is the first choice for adults and children older than 2 years. When 
systemic management is needed, oral calcineurin inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine) 
are appropriate, though oral steroids often are needed for severe cases. The 
need for systemic management can sometimes be delayed with use of diluted bleach 
baths. For acne vulgaris, standard treatments with topical benzoyl peroxide and 
topical or systemic antibiotics are used widely, as are oral contraceptives, but 
oral isotretinoin is the most effective treatment.
