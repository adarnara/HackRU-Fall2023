A soft drug (SD) displays a metabolically labile spot and, after having exerted 
its activity in the site of action, undergoes a fast metabolism, leading to 
inactive metabolites. The SD approach has recently found widespread application 
in the dermatological field because it provides a means of localising the 
therapeutic effect in skin, while minimising systemic exposure. The literature 
is rapidly growing of successful examples of compounds targeting 
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), transient receptor potential 
vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), Janus kinase (JAK), caspase 1, and histone deacetylase 
(HDAC), for the treatment of skin inflammatory, autoimmune, and oncological 
diseases. As a demonstration of the potential of this strategy, the SD approach 
recently led to the approval of crisaborole, a soft phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) 
inhibitor, for atopic dermatitis, while other agents are in clinical 
development.
