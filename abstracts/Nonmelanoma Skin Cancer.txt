This article reviews the most common nonmelanoma skin cancers affecting the head 
and neck region. Although the most common of these malignancies rarely result in 
mortality, local morbidity caused by the tumors and their extirpation cannot be 
underestimated. Complete tumor extirpation with pathologically confirmed 
negative margins is the gold standard. Regional and distant metastases are rare, 
but must be treated appropriately should they occur. Although reconstructive 
surgery can be life changing for the patients and rewarding for the clinicians, 
it behooves the treating surgeons to remain true to oncologic principles above 
all else.
